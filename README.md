# Graph-based-Approach-to-Abstractive-Summarization

We would like to implement the method in “Opinosis: A Graph- Based Approach to Abstractive Summarization of Highly Redundant Opinions”, International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2010. We will refer to this paper as “this paper” and other references as [1], [2], ....
While reading and implementing this paper, we have gained a lot of insights. Therefore, in the final project, we not only write a program but also the literature survey.
The report is organized as follows. First, we will give the motivation for choosing this topic. Second, we will give an introduction to this paper and the concepts that are related to the course. Third, we will describe our program. Fourth, we will state some problems we have encountered during the final project. Finally, we draw our conclusions in the end.
